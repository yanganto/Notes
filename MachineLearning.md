# Machine Learning

- most of machine learning are
	- open source
	- video recornization

- most important things is predicting

---

# work2vec

- 2013 open source by google, but not maintain in google
- 2-layer neural network
	- CBOW 
	- Skip-gram

- first implement with python

> D: [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]  
> E: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]

# CBOW with tri-gram

>[befor word, Keyword, affter word]

**average** mount data will better

# Skip-gram 1-skip 3-grams

>[befor word, Keyword, (skip one), affter word]  

**small** mount data will better

# Cosine Similiarity

- determine the difference of the sentense


---

# flow

- split words
- clean data, normalize


---

# Program develop suggestion
- Combine
- Enhance
- Refactory
